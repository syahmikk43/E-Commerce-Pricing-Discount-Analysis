# E-Commerce-Pricing-Discount-Analysis
Analyzing product pricing, discounts, and RRP across multiple brands and categories.
## 📘 Project Background & Overview
This project focuses on analysing pricing structures and discount behavior in an e-commerce retail environment. The dataset contains product-level details such as brand, category, gender, color, current price, discount, and recommended retail price (RRP).

While it does not include sales or profit data, it still provides valuable insights into how pricing strategies differ across brands and product categories, and how discounts are applied to various product types and demographics.
